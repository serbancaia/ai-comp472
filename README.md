The following packages must be installed in your environment to execute the Python scripts that we wrote for this project:
pip install pillow
conda install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib OR conda install matplotlib
pip install opencv-python==4.5.3.56 
For OpenCV, using the latest version was not compatible with Python 3.6, so we installed a previous version that was found to work online.
The Python scripts prompt the user to enter an absolute file path of the format 'C:\Users\Meliimoon\Documents\Concordia\COMP472\Project-Part1'.
